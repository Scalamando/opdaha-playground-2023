# Platzsy - OpDaHa 2023

![screenshots of the Platzsy app](docs/App-Screenshots.png)

This repo contains the Platzsy app, which was develop as part of the Open Data Hackathon 2023 at the University of LÃ¼beck. Finding the right playground for your children and you can be a challenging task. Platzsy supports you in your search by providing you with the information you need in order to make a decision. This includes

- a map of all local playgrounds
- a filter for your personal criteria
- a detailed view of the playtoys and surrounding activities
- a review section to hear about the experiences of others

## Project Setup

This project consists of two parts: the web app in this repo and a StrapiCMS instance that serves as the backend.

### StrapiCMS

For the StrapiCMS setup refer to the `opdata-platzsy-dataset` repo.

### Web app

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env.local`. Replace the contained environment variables with their actual values. `VITE_APP_API_URL` should point to your strapi instance (`http://localhost:1337` for local dev). For the `VITE_MAP_STYLE_URL` you will need to create an account at https://www.maptiler.com/. After all variables are set, continue:

```sh
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Now you should be able to open the app at http://localhost:5173.

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
